# Quick Practice 🏋️‍♂️

This section is a festival-themed terminal session to master `whoami` and `echo` through hands-on practice.

## Practice Tasks

1. **Check your user**:

   ```bash
   whoami
   ```

2. **Announce the festival**:

   ```bash
   echo "Music Fest 2025 is here!"
   ```

3. **Save your username**:

   ```bash
   whoami > /home/user/festival/planner.txt
   ```

4. **Create a multi-line file**:

   ```bash
   echo -e "Stage 1: Pop\nStage 2: Rock" > /home/user/festival/stages.txt
   cat /home/user/festival/stages.txt
   ```

5. **Make and run a script**:

   ```bash
   echo "echo Planned by: \$(whoami)" > /home/user/festival/credit.sh
   chmod +x /home/user/festival/credit.sh
   ./credit.sh
   ```

6. **Clean up**:

   ```bash
   rm -r /home/user/festival
   ```
