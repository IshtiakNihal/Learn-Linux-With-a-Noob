# Scope Out Files ðŸ“‹

## `ls` - List Files and Folders

- **What it does**: `ls` lists all files and folders in the current directory.
    
- **Why I use it**: Itâ€™s my quick way to see whatâ€™s around me in the terminal, like checking the contents of a drawer.
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    
    Output: `notes.txt photos projects`
    
- **When to use**: Anytime I need a snapshot of my current directory. #ls
    

## `ls -a` - Show Hidden Files

- **What it does**: `ls -a` lists everything, including hidden files and folders (those starting with a dot, like `.bashrc`).
    
- **Why I use it**: Sometimes files are hidden (like system configs), and `ls -a` reveals them.
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    ls -a
    ```
    
    Output: `.bashrc .hidden notes.txt photos`
    
- **When to use**: When I suspect thereâ€™s more in a directory than `ls` shows, like dotfiles. #ls-a
