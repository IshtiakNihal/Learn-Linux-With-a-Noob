# Build Files & Folders üõ†Ô∏è

## `touch` - Create Empty Files

- **What it does**: `touch` creates a new, empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing one.
    
- **Why I use it**: It‚Äôs my go-to for starting a new file, like a blank note or script.
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    touch draft.txt
    ```
    
    Creates `draft.txt` in the current directory. If it already exists, it updates its timestamp.
    
- **Another example**:
    
    ```bash
    touch todo.txt
    ```
    
    Makes a blank `todo.txt` ready for editing.
    
- **When to use**: When I need a placeholder file or want to start fresh. #touch
    

## `mkdir` - Create Folders

- **What it does**: `mkdir` (make directory) creates a new folder.
    
- **Why I use it**: It‚Äôs like making a new binder to organize my files.
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir projects
    ```
    
    Creates a folder named `projects`.
    
- **Another example**:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir photos/vacation
    ```
    
    Creates a `vacation` folder inside `photos` (if `photos` exists).
    
- **When to use**: When I need to organize files into new folders. #mkdir
