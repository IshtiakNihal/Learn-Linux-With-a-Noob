# File Spotlight: Detailed Listings 📋

## `ls -l` - Detailed File Listing

- **What it does**: Displays files and folders in a long format, showing details like permissions, size, owner, and whether a file is a symlink (shortcut).
    
- **Why I use it**: It’s like getting a full report on what’s in my directory—especially helpful for spotting symlinks, which point to files elsewhere.
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    
    Output might look like:
    
    ```
    drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Apr 15 09:00 documents
    -rw-r--r-- 1 user user  123 Apr 15 10:00 notes.txt
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user   25 Apr 15 11:00 link.txt -> /home/user/docs/file.txt
    ```
    
    - `drwxr-xr-x` means `documents` is a directory.
    - `-rw-r--r--` means `notes.txt` is a regular file.
    - `lrwxrwxrwx` with `->` shows `link.txt` is a symlink pointing to `/home/user/docs/file.txt`.
- **Another example**:
    
    ```bash
    ls -l documents
    ```
    
    Lists details for just the `documents` folder’s contents.
    
- **When to use**: When I need to check file properties or find out if something’s a symlink.
    
- **Tip**: The `l` in `lrwxrwxrwx` screams “link,” making symlinks easy to spot! #ls-l
