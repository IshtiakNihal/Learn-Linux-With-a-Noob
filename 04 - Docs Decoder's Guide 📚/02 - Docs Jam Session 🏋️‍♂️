# Docs Jam Session 🏋️‍♂️

This section is a fun terminal workout to make `ls -l`, `man`, and `help` stick through hands-on practice.

## Practice Tasks

1. List files with details:
    
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    
    Look for any symlinks (lines starting with `l` and `->`).
    
2. Create a test directory and file:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir test_folder
    touch test_folder/sample.txt
    ```
    
3. Make a symlink:
    
    ```bash
    ln -s test_folder/sample.txt sample_link.txt
    ```
    
4. Check the symlink:
    
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    
    Confirm `sample_link.txt` points to `test_folder/sample.txt`.
    
5. Explore `ls`:
    
    ```bash
    man ls
    ```
    
    Search for `/long` to find the `-l` option, then press `q` to exit.
    
6. Learn about `cd`:
    
    ```bash
    help cd
    ```
    
7. Move around:
    
    ```bash
    cd test_folder
    pwd
    cd ..
    ```
    
8. Clean up:
    
    ```bash
    rm sample_link.txt
    rm -r test_folder
    ```
